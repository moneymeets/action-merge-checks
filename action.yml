name: Merge checks
description: |
  Set the merge check status for the triggering commit to report on any problems that would block the merge

inputs:
  github_token:
    description: |
      Token with repository permissions, e.g. `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` of the caller workflow
    required: true
  head_sha:
    description: |
      Hash of the HEAD commit.

      We can't consistently use the built-in GITHUB_SHA variable due to differences in triggers, therefore HEAD_SHA
      should be passed explicitly and either set to GITHUB_SHA, or to another appropriate value.
    required: true

runs:
  using: composite

  steps:
    - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

    - run: uv run --project "${{ github.action_path }}" merge_checks_runner
      shell: sh
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ inputs.github_token }}
        HEAD_SHA: ${{ inputs.head_sha }}
